Automaton Processing Project

This academic project consists of coding an algorithm capable of processing any type of automaton â€” including deterministic, non-deterministic, synchronous, and others.

ðŸ§  Objective

The goal was to implement a general-purpose automaton processor in **Python**, handling various automaton types efficiently and in real-time.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- Support for multiple automaton types (DFA, NFA, synchronous, etc.)
- Modular and scalable Python implementation
- Real-time input processing

ðŸŽ“ Context

This project was part of an academic module focused on automata theory and algorithms. It allowed us to apply our theoretical knowledge through hands-on algorithmic implementation.
